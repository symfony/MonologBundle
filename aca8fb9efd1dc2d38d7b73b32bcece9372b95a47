Did you check if this is even needed?

Last time I checked, every monolog handler already casts the log level.

I see no reason for this bundle to cast the level at all.

Why didn't I think of that! You are absolutely right.

By default the [`AbstractHandler`](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/blob/main/src/Monolog/Handler/AbstractHandler.php#L38) constructor calls `setLevel`, which calls `Logger::toMonologLevel($level)`.

I'll check for older versions and update the PR.

`Logger::toMonologLevel` is called [since monolog 1.11](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/commit/feb19af2d42ab598e3e5e77e8f4bd51b82538acb). This is safe to remove the call in the DI extension.
