should we make a release with all the existing changes before that ?

I don't know. I initially wanted to merge / close as many issue as possible and then make a release.
Before I cleanup this project, the changelog was broken. So making a release without burden could be possible on the very last commit of master f51d377648794e8a8a54f889f17a621911295ce9

But IMHO, it's a bit stupid to do a release, and then to continue to merge new things...

I would go for simplicity: do a release after merge of pending PRs (this one, the one about mailer, and a another couples)

I agree, let's do one release with everything, including the bumps for the deps.
