I thought about the design and I think it makes more sense to push the processor to each handler. That way, processing PSR-3 messages can be disabled per handler.

Looks like this does not work for the `event` logger in Symfony. Will dig deeper to figure out why.

I've just tested and it looks good to me. @ged15 Can you rebase?

@fabpot rebased and seems to work for me properly now too. Was a bug in an earlier version of the bundle I think.

Thanks, I'm going to merge this in the 2.x branch as this is both a new feature (BC) and a fix for the current behavior.
