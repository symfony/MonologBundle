Removed the check for the class on the config (e.g for raven it was going berserk, as the package is not required to make the tests run). I did the same for sentry 2.0's handler.

> This change as is makes the older Sentry no longer compatible. IDK if you want to proceed like this.

yes it is,
* raven is for the old one
* sentry is for the new one

Or I missed something?

That's correct, but Sentry 2.0 is pretty recent, so Raven\1.x is still pretty widespread.

Then nothing prevents you from using the `raven` while you're still on the 1.0 ?

I could add something in the doc or somewhere else that says that you can use only one of them at a time, not both.

Could you add a note in the CHANGELOG?
It will be part of 3.5.0
Thanks
