At the moment, php 5 support is dropped from other repos as well (`symfony/symfony`, `symfony/polyfill`) and I don't think we're doing ourselves a favor by maintaining php 5 support for future releases. That being said, old php 5 compatible releases of this package won't disappear after merging this PR.

php 5 is EOL for almost two years now. Let's move on.

We should start to. ğŸ˜ƒ
