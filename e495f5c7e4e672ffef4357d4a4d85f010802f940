Hi @dbrumann, we're in the phase of extending the Extension class of Monolog to have this functionality.
However we would like to have this in the bundle, so that we don't manage it ourselves.

Can we help you to get this functionality merged in the bundle itself?

Thanks in advance!

Thanks @SerkanYildiz. The failing tests should be addressed by #360. I hope after merging that we can also merge this. I guess other than reviewing if this is the appropriate way to solve this, there is not much else to do here, right now.

Could you add a note in the CHANGELOG? after that I'm 👍🏼

I just tried this out in a project and noticed an issue. The following config (when no env var is set) will not work:

```yaml
# config/packages/monolog/dev.yaml
parameters:
    env(LOG_LEVEL): ~
monolog:
    handlers:
        main:
            type: stream
            path: "%kernel.logs_dir%/%kernel.environment%.log"
            level: '%env(LOG_LEVEL)%'
```

~I am working on a fix for this:~

~Option 1: when null is encountered we do not set `$level` which will then use the fallback provided in the handlers constructor (usually "debug").~
Option 2: null is not a valid value --> we fail with an error message 👇
