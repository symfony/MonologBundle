Thank you. Your change makes our test suite green again, which is great of course. But, are we sure this subtle change in behavior won't break stuff downstream?

I had a look while creating the PR, and it seems the `null` possibility was actually handled, even if not possible until now : https://github.com/symfony/monolog-bundle/blob/ed0e4a287282971d110fd8c99d9ac391559a43ce/DependencyInjection/MonologExtension.php#L180-L182
