After the original fix, there were failing tests for `monolog/monolog` v2 because the `AsMonologProcessor::priority` attribute doesn't exist there.

I decided to revert the original fix, added a new test for Monolog v3.4.0 and skip the existing and new tests conditionally based on the used Monolog version.

There's still one failing test setup (PHP 7.3 with Monolog 2.*), but I think this is not related to the changes in this PR.
